    "2. **Flattening** to 2D and filtering values which are used for model training and evaluation. Force and Torque acting is also preserved for future use.\n",
    "3. **Performing selectively random data selection** for capturing different percentage of different type of points (explained below). This required finding the exact co-ordinates of surface points at each given instant of time.\n",

    "5. **Shift of reference frame** from experiment reference from to centre of airfoil reference frame. This is required to simplify the complexity of problem where the model has to **deal with sudden absence of fluid** in a region when airfoil is oscillating up and down. In centre-of-mass of airfoil frame, airfoil remains stationary and hence no such sudden absence. We are also rearning the mapping of y-directional oscillation of the airfoil so as to be able to revert back to our original settings after prediction.\n",
